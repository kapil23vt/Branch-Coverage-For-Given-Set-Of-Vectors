# Branch Coverage for a given circuit description for a set of input vectors.

Compilation Instructions : In the terminal, make sure you are including all the header files. 
Compile the code using g++ -Iinclude include/verilated.cpp Vtop__Syms.cpp Vtop.cpp project0.cpp
Then open the a.out using ./a.out which stores the branch coverage value.

lev_vec.vec is the input file containing all the given vectors.
The first line in this file indicates the number of inputs for a given circuit.
Set Vector is the first vector and reset vector is the last vector
